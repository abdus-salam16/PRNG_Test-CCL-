# Custom Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project implements a **custom Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)** using the **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** algorithm. The PRNG is evaluated for its **uniformity and statistical behavior** by comparing it with NumPy's built-in uniform random number generator.

## Algorithm Used: Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
The LCG generates the next random number using the formula:

Xₙ₊₁ = (a * Xₙ + c) mod m

Where:
- `a` is the multiplier
- `c` is the increment
- `m` is the modulus
- `X₀` is the seed (initial value)
##  Features & Visualizations

1. **Scatter Plots**:
   - Compares the custom PRNG and NumPy’s PRNG output in 2D space.
   - Evaluates randomness and point distribution.

2. **Histograms**:
   - Shows the distribution shape of X and Y values.
   - Helps assess how uniform or skewed the PRNG output is.

3. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Calculates mean and standard deviation of X and Y values.
   - Verifies the closeness to a uniform distribution.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.7+ recommended).
2. Install required packages:

pip install numpy matplotlib
Run the script:

python src/prng_analysis.py
This will:

Generate scatter plots

Show histograms

Print statistical summaries to the terminal

Learning Outcomes
